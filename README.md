# Job Portal Data Visualization Dashboard

This is an interactive Tableau dashboard project visualizing job description data from Kaggle. Created as part of my MBA in Business Analytics coursework, the goal was to extract insights from job listings to understand industry demand, popular skills, and job locations.

## About Me

I'm an MBA Business Analytics student with a passion for turning data into strategic business insights. This project showcases my data visualization skills using Tableau, and data processing abilities using Python.

## Project Overview

- Objective: Analyze job descriptions to uncover trends in hiring, skills demand, location concentration, and job titles.
- Tools Used: Tableau Public, Python (Pandas, NLP), Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset Source: Kaggle - [Job Description Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)

## Key Features of the Tableau Dashboard

- Top Hiring Locations
- Most In-Demand Job Titles
- Skills Frequency Analysis
- Company-wise Job Posting Trends
- Posting Time Trends

## Python Preprocessing & Analysis

Before visualizing in Tableau, the dataset was cleaned and analyzed using Python:

- Removed missing and inconsistent values
- Parsed job descriptions to extract relevant skills
- Conducted frequency analysis on job skills using NLP techniques
- Saved a cleaned version of the dataset for Tableau visualization
